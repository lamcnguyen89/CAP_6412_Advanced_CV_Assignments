The lobby of a 1923 art deco hotel. Checkered marble tiles in muted colors span the floor. Dark oak furniture with red velvet accents are arranged in groups. A grand chandelier hangs above the entryway. Carved columns line the walls. A deep red carpet draws attention to a concierge table and a set of brass elevators.
